hook: text based with a few links

you walk along the forest lost and confused, all of a sudden you find yourself in a town(?) the buildings seem to be limited and all of them are named after a "Nova"
which building do you enter?
you knock on the door of the only house you see which option do you chose?

play diff music depending on what page you're in
posibly change the hook to be a sign based on where you are
