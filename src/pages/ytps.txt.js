// hello and welcome to defining this so i hopefully dont forget what this is about like i did last night
// okay to get on this list you must be one of these things
// 1. a litterally YTP/YTPMV
// 2. funnier old video that was for sure a shitpost or just "fits the theme" (ex: Rainbow Road, machine gun grandma)
// 3. a mashup shitpost (ex: [BIG SHOT]'s World, OPPA SPAMTON STYLE)
// 4. rarely allowed: an old video that should inflict pain due to "ow im old" (ex: Nyan Cat - Genre Hopping)
// none of this actually matters its just kind of how my internal thought process is.

// also this is done this way instead of just a regular txt file because i would like to know what to look for in case a video is deleted.
// also cause the users gonna find out what video theyre watching pretty fast tbh
