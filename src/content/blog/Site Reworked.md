# hello again!
as you all mightve noticed...
the whole site has been reworked!
the sonas pages are in the folder view
everything has the same color scheme
and the front page is <span style="font-family:cursive;">fancy</span>

ive reworked the site to be alot more like a carrd than a stagnant little oc viewer
ive been wanting to do this for awhile as ive gotten demotivated on writing and making new pages for ocs

also im very aware of what some of you are thinking "THE CHARACTER NOOOO ITS GENERIC"
by some of you
i mean me
i am aware the site has lost a bit of its charm
loosing the classic space gif bg
and im not saying that it didnt have anything nice about it
it was vewy nice
however
ive wanted to have something like this for awhile
as i noticed every carrd i had would get shoved into my site and generally neglected till i thought "oh shit i have a carrd right"
id remake it
dislike it
and continue to not use it because "i can just make my own lmao"
well...
i did!
i made my own!
after all this time!
yeah!

also the keen eyed of you mightve noticed "wait theres a fuck ton missing where the hell are alot of your other coding projects you shoved in misc?"
well...
im ashamed to admit...
*i kind of lost alot of that data*
mostly the minecraft xbox 360 minigame world conversions
the rest is backed up locally since it wasnt fucking massive
thats all on me

finally.
while im aware this is a massive change
i want to say
ive changed alot as a person since i started this site
originally starting as a "december diary" hosted on tumblr with hotlinked discord images till i moved to netlify and github with the link
novascoolcharacterdescriptionsinhtmlcoolswagyaa.netlify.app
then i got heavily into hosting myself
with my straight up ip
where xfinity blocked port 80
then after a fuck ton of time i realized i could just move to port 90
then i moved to [noip](https://noip.com) for the novassite.ddns.net domain
then
june of last year
i bit the bullet and bought this domain for 2 years
with google domains.
then they bit the bullet and i moved to cloudflare needing to purchase an extra year (fuck you google kys)

all that aside
im turning 17 in 2 days
and id like to thank everyone whos visited my site(s) across the years
thank you all for making this hobby so fun :)
