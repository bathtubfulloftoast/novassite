rudy mc ruderson
god...

anyways summers come to a weap and i finally have to go back to school and like...
finish highschool...
eugh...
i hate being a functioning member of society...
shit sucks...

# how was your summer

it was pretty good
mostly just relaxed
enjoyed myself
did code
had funge
overheated
died
anyways

# WHAT DID YOU DO WITH THE PI???

ive been using the pi to run the site and proxy for my other server
being tiny and not notable visually i got to shove the pi in the router room
i also got to connect it to ethernet being much faster than the spotty wifi :D
it also has auto power on which is really nice
it also runs [the status page](https://status.novassite.net) constantly for eternity
having something low powered and innocuous is really nice

# WHAT ARE YOU DOING NOW?

crying

my sleeps been shit lately its been like so fun
waking up hours before my alarm is great i love it 

thats all i have to say i go now byeeeeee :D
