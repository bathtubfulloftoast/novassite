so while i was dicking around trying to figure out astro blogging i was looking through [the site of the oneko.js developer](https://adryd.com/) to hopefully help me grasp my tiny little mind around what was going on
spoiler: barely helped
either way while doing this i read her blogpost about her "[Daily Carry](https://adryd.com/pages/daily-carry/)" 
essentially a list of items carried... daily....

now this line 
```Iâ€™m autistic, and I heard somewhere that autistic people like to be prepared for any situation. I definitely see that in myself and tend to overengineer what I daily carry.```
really yknow
kind of clicked
and youll see why soon.

# backpack
i only have like one real bag so
yknow
yeag

## front pocket
this one isnt actually all that important i just put garbage in there whenever theres no trashcan around (tragic)

## middle pocket
this is where the real shit happens
inside of this pocket i have yet another bag
a rainbow bag with the suicide hotline on it.
i got this at a "Wellness Presentation" my school does every tuesday
i only kept it because it was really fucking funny having it be gay and suicidal (just like me fr)
okay lets talk about whats inside of it

### the bag inside of my bag
inside of this bag i keep many of my wires and extras

- Hdmi Cable
- USB C to C Cable
- USB C to A Cable
- USB C to AUX Adapter
- USB C Headphones (Broken)
- USB C to HDMI/USB A Dongle
- USB A to lightning
- 20$ Skullcandy wireless earbuds (hot pink)
- Keys

youll notice alot of junk
this is a runnning theme
anyways i carry a bunch of dongles and shit specifically for my steam deck in case of a tv emergency

## outside of the bag inside of my bag
i still have more pocket space in here, i just put all the jagged shit in the bag inside of my bag
here i keep
- Sunglasses
- Battery Bank
- Purple Pen
- Phone (when not in use)

## main pocket
