# Hello World!
its me 
your faaaavooorrrittteee :)

its a new year which means people try new things 
and then hate them
but me...
im different...
im trying something i already know i hate...
<b style="color:red">javascript.</b>
now ive dabbled in js before but now im like properly trying to do something with it
so far ive made a coin flip and redid the cool message thing
so far 
so bad 
they work but dear god javascript is so dense
look at this
``Math.floor(Math.random() * 2);``
what do you think it does?
as a php developer it looks like it gets a random number of default values and multiplies it by 2
the javascript bastard who wrote it knows it gets a number between 0-1
now 
as a nerd i know subtract your expecations by 1 because we start from 0 
but this
THIS ISNT COUNTING BY STARTING FROM 0
WHY IS IT ONE MORE????
i know future me is judging me hardcore rn but fuck you what do you know hoe
also javascript developers but whatever
was this whole blogpost mostly just an excuse to complain about js?
yes.

anyways

# how have you been?
ive been 
ffffiiiineeee??
ive been hella burnt out recently and mostly demotivated
but its fiiiiiiiinnnneeeeee

# what
what?

# are you still single bbg~?
yes :(

ive run out of ideas uh 
i love you :D
