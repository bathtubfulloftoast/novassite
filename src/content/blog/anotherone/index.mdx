// fuck you like actually why are you hard

# we'll... meet again....
## dont know where
### dont know when!
**but i know well meet again some sunny day!**

in the famous words of dj khaled
"another one"

after my brief stint in the jackson 5 everything went to shit and i had to move
i was forced to move after miachel took the fame and left the rest of us in the dust

*radio buzz*

*wait i wasnt in the jackson 5?*
*im not even remotely related to anyone in the jackson 5??*
thats bs.

anyways yeah
i had move house for reasons unknown (hint: it rhymes with schmank schmupsy) 
however i got back up on my feet pretty quick getting my site up with only 4 days of solid downtime
and now were here!
me with a total 3 hours of sleep because adding more protections to the guestbook was more important than anything else i had going on (it wasnt)
also apologies if this is more confusing than usual
said reason yknow
either way!

# hows this house you keep speaking of?
its pretty nice all things considered
its my "childhood" home 
aka the house i was first brought home to after being born
so it holds a few memories

# how the fuck did you bounce back so quick??
well you see 
ive moved alot in my life

albuquerque
los lunas
belen
meadow lake
**meadow fucking lake**
<b style="color:red;"><i>MEADOW FUCKING LAKE</i></b>

YALL

side tangent
fuck meadow lake 
youd think its this nice quaint little town
a nice break from all the desert

[look for yourselves motherfuckers](https://maps.app.goo.gl/tyLLGCmZ3WDvGGbv5)
LOOK FOR YOURSELVES.

ITS THIS OPEN AREA WITH NOTHING BUT <span title="i dont like sand. - anakin skywalker">*SAND*</span> MADE OF BEER BOTTLES AND CRUSHED DREAMS.
if anyone visits new mexico
go to meadow lake and experience the worst of the worst before you experience the "fun" parts
like lottaburger
fucking love lottaburger (so many burger...)
also dions is mid and i dont care what yall think

side tangent over 
uh
yeah ive moved alot in my life 

## christ that was alot...
### anyways.
# how do you feel about the whole situation?

im gonna be honest
the last house i was in 
we moved into this house after living in meadow lake for 2 years (for the second time in my life)
so knowing what i couldve had to endure
not fun
however
we had a chance to move here (where i currently am)
or texas
so glad i didnt move to texas

its never fun moving
i had alot of memories in that house

<img src={swagimage.src} />

cool ass sideways tree for example
since the day we moved into that house i absolutely loved that tree.
it grew in wrong and it was just entirely sideways
but it was still alive
it was just a tree but sideways

that house is also where i first realized i wanted to be alice.
one day i had woken up and thought to myself 
"ive been having this identity crisis for the past week
i have no idea who i am or who i want to be
ive wanted to be a girl for so long but i never thought of actually *doing* it
...
you know what.
when i get out of bed today
im going to narrate what i do.
but as if im a girl."

then i took a FAT piss 
and well
it stuck.
(the gender not the piss)
june 22nd 2020.

that was one of the most important pisses ive ever had.
that piss decided my identity.
thank you piss.

so much had happened in the 5 years i lived in that house.
its sad to see it go.
but at the very least someone will have this blogpost and that photo to try and doxx me at some point in the future.
and thats the most a gal can hope for

# final thoughts?
moving house is never fun
but ive bounced back pretty well and theres still more life for me to live
at the very least i dont have to worry about moving for awhile
i love yall
see you in hell &lt;3
