so ive had the [pi 5](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-5/?variant=raspberry-pi-5-8gb) and [pi 500](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-500/) for awhile now and i like them both alot!

# pi 500
so first i bought the raspberry pi 500 on june 10th (the day after my birthday) because i had some money to spend and i just fucking hate having money so i gave it to [pishop.us](https://pishop.us/) 

## frist thoughts
### packaging
the packaging was very nice with everything being in its own little box
despite the fact i <i style="opacity:0.5;">clearly</i> know how to develop i really like the book
its substancial and nice to flip through even if i dont need the tips

## first impressions
right after i had it in my hands i loved it 
i loved the possibilities 
flashing all the random things to it then seeing what it could run
i ran almost everything avalible on the pi flasher

## finding a use for it
soon i realized i had no permanant setup for it
all my monitors were taken up and i had just spent all my money on the pi itself...
after awhile i realized i could probably try hosting my site and all the nginx proxying on it
and to be honest it went great!
so great i realized i needed more than 32 gigabytes to store the whole fucking os on
i also realzied i wanted a bit more of a subtle thing than an entire keyboard just fucking lying there
i also realized it ruined the point to have this fun keyboard computer and only use it over the internet with other keyboards
realizing this i chose to buy the

# pi 5
**also titled the pi 005** is a really fucking cool system thats so fuckign small oh my god its so teensy oh my god its barely larger than the pocket knife i used to open the box that contained it oh my god

## first impressions
### packaging
so after waiting like 2 more days than what was estimated by usps i got the pi! (pishop.us did their job good its just usps being fucky they litterally got it to usps like within the hour i bought it, it was crazy)
finally i got the box which was very oversized for the 2 things contained it (the pi 5 and its case) (i already had all the chargers and decided to use a 128gb sd card i already had)
i realized that the pi itself is just
encased in a little fucking "cigarette box" from like the 50s
thin ass cardboard you have to tear apart to see the loose fucking board
the cases packaging was better
it was also in the corner of the box with packing paper haphazardly shoved in there
it wasnt protected from SHIT.
(this is infact pishops fault that is not how that works)
still whatever it worked

## setting up the device itself
since this isnt the pi 500 and is more a tiny desktop i had to assemble the thing
being my first pi and remembering my trauma from the last time i tried to deal with tiny things 
(hint: i fucking broke both of the dses i had)
i was quite fearful tearing off the fan connector cover
not only that putting on the heatsync was also a bit frightful because touching and applying force to the fucking capacitors on the back sucked ass
though after i got everything plugged in it was so fucking cool
flashing the os was quick and easy and i didnt even have to plug in a keyboard!11!
mostly because i setup a default config in the pi flasher with ssh enabled
also i only had to plug in the display during setup so it could show me my ip
after getting it all done i made it forget my wifi and plugged it into ethernet

## running the device permanantly
so now i run the device constantly hosting quite a few services
like a few discord scripts and julesbot
also my site and anubis
it does all of this really well
i dont really need more than the 8gb of ram i bought
it usually idles 45~55&deg;C from what ive seen peeking in on the statistics i put on the profile page
usually it idles closer to 50 but whatevz
i could actually make a script to read it consistently and then get the average from there but fuck you i dont like your ideas they suck die

# final words
the raspberry pi is a really cool device that does quite a bit for the price
with pretty similar spec'd phones being like 10* the price its really fucking cool to run a whole ass desktop on the thing
also the community constantly making new things for the pi is also really fucking sweet
being able to run android and ubuntu and hell even windows is so freakig cool
also despite not buying upgrades seeing whats possible excites me to no end
adding POE to the pi with a little board that just has all the power capabilites is so cool
being able to add an m.2 slot iss also really inticing and i would really like to do that with my pi
however thats all spensive and owwieee wallet hurtyyy
seeing how far the pi has come from its early days in 2015 its so amazing to finally have one of these
