but harder
jesus christ its a good movie
*oh my god its a great movie*
*but oh my god does it make me sob*

either way
i could go on and on about the specifics of how it relates to me and my experience being transgender but
as it tends to be
itl get p sad

so lets go onto
the other media i was talking about

which issss

the entire vylet pony discography!!
for most of my friends *and the stalkers who refresh my site every day yall the real ones love you*

youll know that i got last.fm specifically for my little binge
and said binge happened because i got sillybrained after girls who are wizards
and i want to say
all of it has changed me
changed me in a few ways
i love life again.
yeah

love yall
baiii X3
