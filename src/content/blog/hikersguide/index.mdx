so youre trapped in an endless hellish abyss that wants your private info.
what do you do?

# Step 1 (Do your own research)
what services do you most care about?
google photos, youtube, github?
search for alternatives?
hell, tired of google?
find an alternative!

for example:
<br></br>though its indexed much less than google [startpage](https://www.startpage.com/) has been working pretty well for me.
<br></br>[git.gay](https://git.gay) is an independent git source from *gay people...* ***shiver***
<br></br>scared of gay people? try [forgejo](https://forgejo.org/) (the software git.gay is based on)
<br></br>[invidious](https://invidious.io/) is an amazing youtube mirror that *for me* works better than most others
<br></br>invidious isnt for you? try [free tube](https://freetubeapp.io/)
<br></br>[gitfiend](https://gitfiend.com/) has also been a big help for letting me switch from github.
<br></br>too fiendish? try [gitnuro](https://gitnuro.com/) an alternative that might work better for you.
<br></br>have an extra hard drive lying around and want your images backed up? try [immich](https://immich.app/).
<br></br>dont like windo-
<br></br>use [linux](https://archlinux.org/) use [linux](https://linuxmint.com/) use [linux](https://manjaro.org/) use [linux](https://endeavouros.com/) use [linux](https://www.debian.org/) use [linux](https://system76.com/pop/) use [linux](https://fedoraproject.org/) use [linux](https://store.steampowered.com/steamos) use [linux](https://kubuntu.org/) use [linux](https://www.gentoo.org/) use [linux](https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/)

overwhelmed with options? [just download mint](https://linuxmint.com/edition.php?id=319).
still overwhelmed? [just.. click here...](https://pub.linuxmint.io/stable/22.1/linuxmint-22.1-cinnamon-64bit.iso)
do you want even more options??? go to [distrowatch](https://distrowatch.com/)

linux tangent over sorry

point is, there are several alternatives.

## Step 1.2 (What specifically is the alternative??)
sometimes some alternatives aren't the way to go.
depending on the service you want to replace you must have a specific type of alternative.
like youtube for example
you're most likely going to want a youtube *mirror* not a youtube *replacement* 
what makes youtube youtube is not how it tubes you.
but the creators that are on it
just switching to vimeo isnt going to help unless the contents there too.

# Step 2 (Download the media you love.)
in the famous words of cybershell.

(taken from [operation soda steal](https://inv.nadeko.net/watch?v=fD7X9SCn0To))


i dont care if its copyrighted or not
hell if its even from an independent creator
download that shit and be ready to upload/seed it

i understand why pirating indie games is bad 
i understand the moral implications.
however if you just cant afford that 

## PIRATE THAT SHIT

while the average sentamate is that independent creators will kill you and your family for getting free videos game
the reality is different.
many independent artists coming from the modern times *have* pirated things themselves.

as an example you can look at the anti-piracy screen for just shapes and beats (an indie game)
<video controls src={JSAB}></video>

hey maybe even go to https://www.ipiratedwereallgonnadie.com/
an official website made by the independent studio that made the move were all gonna die (rocketjump) to support the movie if you pirated it and still wanted to fork over some mula.
hell freddie wong put the movie up onto pirating services ***himself***

not enough?
if youre a vylet pony fan you probably already know but vylet pony *an independent music creator* has endorsed piracy aswell.
heres a screenshot of me making a basic search of the *public* discord server.
<img src={pouny.src}></img>
still dont believe me?
just listen to love & ponystep.
like at all.

** Update: **
<img src={boycott.src}></img>
for bandcamp friday vylet directly advocated for pirating her music.
** End Update **

these are some examples in the 3 major forms of media
music, video, and game.

remember the definition of stealing is ``the action or offence of taking another person's property without permission or legal right and without intending to return it; theft``
to *take* is to ``remove (someone or something) from a particular place``
piracy does not remove the original.
if you *cant* or *wont* buy the original anyways nobody is actually losing money.


# Step 3 (Sacrifice)
im not talking lambs here im talking morals and pride.
youre going to have to do some things you will feel wrong about.
its going to suck
but its necessary to be free.

you might not have to kill your dog but going to a shady piss colored site with 480p episodes of rick and morty is going to feel a bit wrong at first
remember cheap doesnt equal danger
the people providing these services are just people just like you or me.

the guy who made the pirate bay?
his name is [Gottfrid Svartholm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfrid_Svartholm) and he was born in sweden.

# The End

remember were all just people on this earth trying to do our best.

and also remember, despite the fact companies have CEOs and employees they are not ran by people.
especially if they're on the stock market.
there are many companies and people willing to sacrifice their fellow man to make a quick buck.
and think about this
this one single fact

**your health insurance provider can deny you.**

think about that one fact, everything that led it to be a possibility
maybe research the history of american healthcare
and think.

this is all i have to say for now
remember
you are loved and cared about and you are more than just a data point.
you have a life
you've had a life
you are an individual.
isnt that beautiful?
