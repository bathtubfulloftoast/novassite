# Them Gals are Wizards!!

HELLO EVERYBODY
so for those of you who haven't read my last post
girls who are wizards premiered last night at 7PM MST
and oh my GOD was it fucking amazing

for those who couldn't make it ([on the discord side atleast](https://discord.gg/vyletpony))
## THE MUSIC NEVER STOPS NO!!
anyways-

# JUST TELL US HOW IT WAS ALREADY
## (sorry for yelling) :(
yeah...
you better be :(
that was really mean.

anyways...
the album was PEAK
on the ranking of vylet pony albums its a high s tier alongside cutiemarks

genuinely
i had woken up at 12AM to catch the album at 7PM and finish it at 8
it did not feel like an hour had passed and that's really good
i am so happy i was able to catch it in full
the end
oh my GOD
HEARING THAT LIVE FUCKING HIT
SO HARD DUDE
SO FUCKING HARD.
YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND.
genuinely listen for yourself if you haven't already (the video will be at the bottom of this post)

# how was the community side?
thank you for not yelling this time
and it was AMAZING
for those who know me you'll know i usually stay to myself and keep to one on one interactions
face to face no funny business
but catching this
seeing everyone's live reactions as each track played
it was
amazing
i never participate in this massive stuff just because it gets overwhelming
but this
it was so
amazing
im so fucking happy i got to be apart of this
and for those who are like me
don't be scared to have fun with a crowd every now in then
especially if its in a community you love
you already have one thing in common with everyone there
so be yourself
in the words of vylet pony herself
"fuck the cynicism let the colors fly!
don't care you think its cringe cus its not your life!!"

# final thoughts
the best moments in life are moments that you live
if you're scared to do something
do it scared
most of the time it will turn out better than you expect
if you wanna tell me your thoughts you can find me in the vylet pony discord
love yall
and most importantly
love life
