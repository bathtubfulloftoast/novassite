hello.
nothing special i dont have the energy.
trump won.
no denying it.
the cult leader with dimensia is going to be president
the man who has stolen documents harmed several women and has described anyone of my kind as enemies of the state.
for as easy as it is to go up and say "be yourself and piss them off" that is scary.
for as much as i will say i want to kill myself
i dont want to die.
i want to live.
i will live.
the best thing we can do is have hope.
this will not be easy.
we can do this.

for as much as i want to be able to look at the person in the mirror and say "thats me"
that wont be possible.
that scares me.
i might die without being able to be me.
thats the scariest part of all this.
i dont have any energy to remotely form my thoughts
im so tired.
bye.
