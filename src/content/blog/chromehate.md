# hello all!!
time to bitch about chrome!!!!!

i utterly despise chrome
why is that?

reason #1

# its not *your* browser
just like your average linux user i care about owning my software
with chrome its so clear that its not *your* browser
with the restrictions added to adblockers (wonder why ***google*** would want that??)
the fact
that dark mode 
DOESNT FUCKING APPLY.
im sorry but if i set the ***browser*** to dark mode maybe the ***browser*** should tell my site that its in dark mode
just like FIREFOX does
im sorry google but maybe i
a. dont want to set my whole systems color scheme to dark for a few websites
b. CANT ACCESS SYSTEM SETTINGS ON EVERY COMPUTER.
c. dont want to implement a whole complicated dark/light mode switcher for the site because it doesnt fit in

for a bit i did have the switcher
but everything i tried was just
ugly or unclear

# google smells
as an official pixel owner i of all people can say google is pretty shit about how they handle software
not only did the forced google app kill batteries of many phones in 2023
or the fact quite a few pixels had their storage not be mounted making me and many others lose a fuck ton of data because they assumed that their phones storage wouldnt get utterly fucked
WHICH IS ONLY AN ISSUE BECAUSE ANDROID DOESNT LET YOU SEE THE FULL FILESYSTEM EVEN IN THE ***DEBUG*** MODE.

not to mention google killing google domains right after i had gotten my domain and selling all domains to squarespace who was charging 20$ per year (compared to the 14$ i had paid this was bs) not to mention the fact squarespace casually dropped the little factoid they were going to charge you whenever they wanted not regaurding your already existing plan (atleast thats how i read it whenever it happened)

all of this is to say
google is idiotic and i have no idea how theyre in business
(i can say its because of idiots like me who want a phone that can be unlocked and flashed)
and the fact theyre too massive to avoid
its a matter of convienence 
googles shit is free
gmail, youtube, chrome, docs, sheets, maps, earth, meet, messages, drive, translate, photos
etc etc
you get it.
and you and i both use many of these services
its okay i get it...
proton costs money and youre a poor little baby who cant afford appy juice [i want appy juice :( ]
and youtube is so nice!
the alternatives are so inconvienent not to mention the downtime and the fact you could be replacing one data stealer for another unless you do this fuck ton of research
i get it.
i know i host a bunch of my own shit on the same terrible laptop but dear god do i not want to deal with invidious (ily but die)

## google messages and RCS
side tangent
now that apple is implementing RCS into apple messages lets actually discuss what supports RCS

so out of [all these options](https://play.google.com/store/search?q=sms&c=apps) for sms apps
what might support rcs?
the top rated ones obv 
google messages verizion ofc
wait not verizion..?
well
ofc it looks like it hasnt been updated since 2009 
okay textra?
no?
why not?
okay maybe-

JUST KIDDING.
THE SUPPORTED APPS ARE 
- google messages
- samsung messages (sometimes)

okay well it makes sense if you think about it!
imessage is the only app that supports... imessage... yeah.
well yeah ofc
this is because: apple doesnt let you install any other sms app

well ofc the default android messaging app would be the only one supported-
wrong!
androids default sms is either dead or shit
i forgot
however google messages is a choice
so imagine with me for a sec 
imagine fucking whatsapp begs apple oh so dearly "PLEASEPLEASEPLEASEPLEASEPLEASEPLEASEPLEASEPLEASEPLEASEPLEASEPLEASEPLEASEPLEASEPLEASEPLEASEPLEASEPLEASEPLEASEPLEASEPLEASEPLEASEPLEASE" for a few years 
shoving billboards with source code for apple to implement whatsapp integration into imessage
itd seem silly right?
like its an optional app
yeah its better than sms but that bar is hella low nowadays
google hasnt open sourced the api for RCS meaning nobody but them and whoever they allow can use it 
so if you want a feature not provided in google messages
shit outta luck bud :D 
well i mean... 
you caaaan...
but the "android standard" wont be supported :/
sorry bud :(
nothing we can do :((

# why are you so mad???
dark mode didnt apply to the site because chrome is ass and i had to remove the implementation i had because i dont prefer light mode and i dont have a choice because GOOGLE WONT LET ME PERMANANTLY SET THE FLAG.

also firefox has better css dev tools im just saying

[please download firefox](https://getfirefox.com) [its only alive because google has to pay them](https://12ft.io/https://fortune.com/2024/08/05/mozilla-firefox-biggest-potential-loser-google-antitrust-search-ruling/) [or else theyll get sued](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Microsoft_Corp.#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20government%20accused%20Microsoft,United%20States%20v.)

also ignore how this became a google hate post rather than just the chrome hate
uh 
fuck you
