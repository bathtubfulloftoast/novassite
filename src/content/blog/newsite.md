# hello again!
its been awhile since ive made a real blogpost
and well
i dont have a real excuse ive just been tired
uhhhh

## WHY IS EVERYTHING JAVASCRIPT I THOUGHT YOU HATED JAVASCRIPT WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING I HATE YOU
WOAH WOAH BUDDY IM SORRY DONT COME AT ME LIKE THAT
i know i know...
i said i was learning javascript and well 
i am..!
its going decently well currently
only minor issues trying to find out how to "fuck it we ball" my way through everything
however its working well!!!
i made the main api calls (mostly) javascript 
only reason stuff is serverside is cause yknow
*api keys*
yeah!

## WHY THE FUCK ARENT YOU HOSTING THE SITE YOURSELF ANYMORE WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU????
GOD
YOU ARE
FUCKING VIOLENT TODAY.

anyways-
i know.
im using netlify now.
its scary.
and *limiting*
but as they say limitations breed innovation!
im using netlify and github just becuse theyre shit
the hope is that i can force myself to learn different types of server side code
especially the stuff that has to get built like with netlify
also finally [the site is open source!](https://github.com/bathtubfulloftoast/novassite)
and *hopefully* more reliable!
if my internet gets fucky the site is still up!
just not the api stuff

i hope you all can understand...
also this is still selfhosted!
*for the time being*
i dont really host many images with this so.

SPEAKING OF IMAGE HOSTING!!!
the cdn will remain selfhosted 
indefinately.
just because yknow 
upload limits...
*shiver*
ill miss shoving gigabytes of files onto people...
sigh........
also the lastfm coverart converter is swag as fuck and id rather keep that as php
YEAG!

i think thats it...
bbbye :)
