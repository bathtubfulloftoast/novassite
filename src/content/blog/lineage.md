# HIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
okay so recently i installed [lineageos](https://lineageos.org/) onto [my tablet](https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/gta4lwifi/) due to the fact that samsungs android
is ass 
i dont like it
im not a fan of having a fuck ton of random bullshit shoved on me (aka ***all*** of googles shitty apps)
fun fact 
i dont need **ALL** of googles fucking apps
i dont use google one 
i use my own youtube client *revanced my beloved*
because i can only ensure that i dont get ads if i use a seperate fucking client [*cough cough premium users getting ads*](https://www.google.com/search?q=youtube%20premium%20users%20getting%20ads)
dont we love google!

anyways those gripes are merely ONE side of samsungs bullshit
not to mention the stupid limitations (need usb to be plugged in to access recovery/download mode)
i understand that one though.
but still
for all these forcibly installed apps and the 32 gigabytes on this tablet
youd think "just uninstall them!"
well.
I TRIED.
theres a funny thing about trying to uninstall these apps
you see 
it *lets* you uninstall them
you go through the whole process
its all nice
how clean!
wait.
why is it back.
IT REINSTALLS THE FUCKING APPS.
not to mention that theyre gonna be unsupported soon because samsung has stopped supporting it 
*now doubted android 15 is barely different to android 12 except for random security shit or pixel specific features but whatever*
all that matters is its out of support 
also you have the fact that "hey i remember this feature existing" you google it because of samsungs dogshit settings app being a confusing fucking mess to try and find anything in 
you see an old forum post saying "of course you can install apps to your sd card! just go here!"
you go there 
nuh uh 
diferent link 
"oh actually go here!"
you go there 
nothing 
another
"they removed this feature in 2017."
ok.
or nobody fucking says it and everythings just like "oh yeah you can do it ofc!!!" and you cant fucking find the setting 

talking ab googling shit ab samsung 
you always have to specify samsung because why the fuck not
samsung just changes shit in the tiniest most unimportant ways that just fuck you over so you cant just do the thing for *every* other damn android device
its stupid
ITS STUPID.

samsungs android is just so fucking cumbersome in every way imaginable
but lineageos...
its so amazing
i love the freedom of just
having a working fucking os 
not to mention the wide support 
due to the fact its *oppeennnn sooourrrcceee :DD*
i love open source software
it means the switch can have a valid version of android that isnt basic and ugly

*speaking of switch android*
i homebrewed my gen 1 switch in 2022 meaning that ive used some of the earlier versions of some homebrew
doubted with homebrew for current consoles everythings *always* changing so 
anyways 
i used the earlier version of switch android 
android 10 i wanna say?
maybe 9 
it was so slow
cumbersome
barely worked 
were on like android 11 now
hell i mean android 10 was such an upgrade
which is ironic cause usually newer versions are slower but it wasssnntttt :3 
it was so good i wanted to install it to the nand because switchos fucked itself up and wouldnt restore
anyways
:3333

this has been another loose thought disguised as a blogpost 
see yall in hell 
i love you
