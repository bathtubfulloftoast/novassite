# Hello Again!
so as the summer starts to wind down and the excitement wears off we enter july
i hope you all have had an amazing summer so far
despite not going out much i still feel like ive done quite a bit
mostly with the site

ive created a page for <a href="/sonas/people/My Sonas/Starlight/">Starlight</a> (a mix of nova and another character)
as of like
literally right now ive updated the random coding projects to look better with the new layout

a few things have started to go under however [ReConsole](https://l4j.novassite.net) is starting to die due to generally being bored
and a funny project i haven't thought to speak about (a video about the icarly reboot purely for shits and giggles) is slowly just
flopping itself into hell
because spending a month of your time on a video about the icarly reboot especially if you havent ever made a video before is just...
dull.
especially when you have the funny thing named ✨ADHD✨
you know its all fun having silly problems with your brain
until they're problems
anywhoooo

lets talk about me and what i like yaaay
if you dont like that
why are you on my site
who do you want, dave grol?
