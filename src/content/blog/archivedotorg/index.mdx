// WHY DO COMMENTS NEED TO BE HERE????????????

hello everyone
as some of you might have noticed
the [internet archive](https://archive.org) is down
and as less of you might've noticed
archive.org had this popup appear not too long before
<img src={swagimage.src} ></img>

so first off
HIBP is short for [have i been pwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/). a website that shows data breaches you have been in
and a website my email is now apart of due to the fact i had an archive.org account

next off
**THIS IS BAD.**
the internet archive is more than the funny site to see old nintendo or old google
the internet archve is the only way to see the history of the internet
the internet archive is
old research papers and other... old stuff.
older versions of the software you use
and other old stuff
this is an understatement
with PETABYTES of data (1 petabye is 1000000 gigabytes or 200000 dvds! OR 333333333 floppy disks! *please dont check my math*)
the internet archive is the most intensive archive thats freely accessible
emphasis on FREE
being a non profit sure does help the internet archive
however it doesnt mean that its still not alot of money to operate

theres alot to say about the fact this was able to happen in the first place
you cant run off good will forever
"[because as long as theres 2 people on the planet someones gonna want someone dead](https://youtu.be/9NZDwZbyDus?si=UMtA18xonU8-S6TK&t=23)"

the point is
the internet archive is VERY important.
so do what you can to help
(which isnt much atm)

also im gonna be so fr these hackers might get killed for this like
man
have a good day
see yall in hell
