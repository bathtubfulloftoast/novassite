# Welcome to the blog!
hello everybody!!
welcome to the first ever blogpost!
here is were i will discuss plans on the site and general stuff about myself!

# Plans
## Rework site
recently i have been wanting to redo the site
aside from everything being a little funky *especially stuff on lower res screens (and mobile)*
and all just generally being a bit old
ive been thinking of reworking it

## what do you mean "rework"
basically i mean making everything look like its supposed to go together
and making it easier to edit code
as well as add themes :D
i also mean rewriting splashes
and prettying up this blog
which leads me to my next point!

## why does the blog look like ass?
well you see
this is because i already plan to be reworking the site (just kidding its because im lazy i tricked you)
the blog looks like ass simply because i am lazy
not much else tbh

# the end of the first blog post :(
while it might not be much i just wanted to make a blog post and a blog to say i wanna change stuff!!!
yeah!!!
byeee :)
