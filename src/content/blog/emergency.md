hello everybody
recently a bunch of life stuff has hit me in the face harder than a ton of bricks and ive had to make some comprimises for the coming weeks
first off
ive made a temp "[Emergency Site](https://github.com/bathtubfulloftoast/emergencysite)" which doesnt rely on myself for hosting
its the barebones of the site without any of the api calls or fun stuff, hosted on github.
this will be applied some point in the future whenever its actually needed

## well what happened??
the short of it
i will have to move
and not for the fun reasons.

## how can i support you?
well you can just find me on my other linked sites and have a more BORING direct non site experience.
however if you really want to directly feel like youre doing something
[you can donate.](https://buymeacoffee.com/bathtubfulloftoast)
now this is NOT needed
its obviously preferred for me since i get money
however
remember yall
i am a random internet fuckhead you are under no obligation to make my issues yours.
however itd be nice if a few people did take some time to donate

# okay yeah we get it sellout
## how long will it take for the site to be back up properly?
obviously with most things in life theres no saying.
the preferred timeframe is none
theres still the tiniest of all chances i wont have to move
however with how things have come its too high of a chance to not put in action early.

## why tell us this?
considering this is my site
aka the place to find everything about me
and this regaurds the site and me
its something i feel should be told.

while i understand this is much too personal to keep emotions out my intention here is information first.
i know asking for donations even once sours everything 
however i want yall to remember
youre not a bad person for not doanating
these are my issues not yours
its just preferred for me 
i know nobody gives as much of a shit as i do about it LMAO
however
yeah

i love yall 
see you in hell
