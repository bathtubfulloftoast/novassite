# what makes an interesting website?

* be unique
* important stuff is right in front of you without any need to scroll
* a GRABBER (something to catch your attention) (eg. blank page with creepy image)

# current issues with my own site
* too mobile focused
    * for someone who cares about the "free internet" its too rounded and "modern")
* too scattered
    * stuff loosely fits together with an overall theme of "i did it :D"
    
# what would i like to keep?
* splashes
* last.fm integration

# what do i want to add?
* blogposts to the front page.
