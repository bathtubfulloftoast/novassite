## why is it all javascript now?
the reason for this is because i want to challenge myself.
i need ***limits***
i need to use the free edition of something and challenge myself to work client side instead of server side.

## you have become what youve sworn to destroy.
i am aware.
i love being selfhosted i love php i love shoehorning shit in and forcing it to work the way i want
however.
i feel i have stagnated lately and i *need* a challenge
i want to make more shit and i need it to be great
so to do this i have to sacrifice some things i love.
if this doesnt work the way i want it to i will make sure to cry on camera
